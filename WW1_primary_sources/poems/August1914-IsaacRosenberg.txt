What in our lives is burntIn the fire of this?The heart's dear granary?The much we shall miss?Three lives hath one life—Iron, honey, gold.The gold, the honey gone—Left is the hard and cold.Iron are our livesMolten right through our youth.A burnt space through ripe fields,A fair mouth's broken tooth.
