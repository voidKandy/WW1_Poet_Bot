                         IOnly a man harrowing clods    In a slow silent walkWith an old horse that stumbles and nods    Half asleep as they stalk.                        IIOnly thin smoke without flame    From the heaps of couch-grass;Yet this will go onward the same    Though Dynasties pass.                        IIIYonder a maid and her wight    Come whispering by:Warâ€™s annals will cloud into night    Ere their story die.
