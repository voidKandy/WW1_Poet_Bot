We ate our breakfast lying on our backs,Because the shells were screeching overhead.I bet a rasher to a loaf of breadThat Hull United would beat HalifaxWhen Jimmy Stainthorpe played full-back insteadof Billy Bradford.  Ginger raised his headAnd cursed, and took the bet; and dropt back dead.We ate our breakfast lying on our backs,Because the shells were screeching overhead.
