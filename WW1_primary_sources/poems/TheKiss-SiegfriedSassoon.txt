To these I turn, in these I trustâ€”Brother Lead and Sister Steel.To his blind power I make appeal,I guard her beauty clean from rust.He spins and burns and loves the air,And splits a skull to win my praise;But up the nobly marching daysShe glitters naked, cold and fair.Sweet Sister, grant your soldier this:That in good fury he may feelThe body where he sets his heelQuail from your downward darting kiss.
