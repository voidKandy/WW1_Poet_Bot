What if I know, Liebknecht, who shot you dead.Tiergarten trees unrollstaggering shadow, in spite of it all.I am among the leaves; the inevitablevoiceshave nothing left to say, the holed headbleeding across a heap of progressive magazines;torn from your face,trees that turned around,we do not sanctify the land with our wandering.Look upon our children, they are mutilated.
