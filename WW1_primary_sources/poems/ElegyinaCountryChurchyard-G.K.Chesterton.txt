The men that worked for EnglandThey have their graves at home:And birds and bees of EnglandAbout the cross can roam. But they that fought for England,Following a falling star,Alas, alas for EnglandThey have their graves afar. And they that rule in England, In stately conclave met, Alas, alas for England They have no graves as yet.
