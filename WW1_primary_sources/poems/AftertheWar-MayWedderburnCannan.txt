After the war perhaps I'll sit againOut on the terrace where I sat with you,And see the changeless sky and hills beat blueAnd live an afternoon of summer through.I shall remember then, and sad at heartFor the lost day of happiness we knew,Wish only that some other man were youAnd spoke my name as once you used to do.
