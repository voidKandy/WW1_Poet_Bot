She was a villageOf lovely knowledgeThe high roads left her aside, she was forlorn, a maid —Water ran there, dusk hid her, she climbed four-wayed.Brown-gold windows showed last folk not yet asleep;Water ran, was a centre of silence deep,Fathomless deeps of pricked sky, almost fathomlessHallowed an upward gaze in pale satin of blue.And I was happy indeed, of mind, soul, body evenHaving got givenA sign undoubtful of a dear England fewDoubt, not many have seen,That Will Squele he knew and was so shriven.Home of Twelfth Night — Edward Thomas by Arras fallen,Borrow and Hardy, Sussex tales out of Roman heights callen.No madrigals or field-songs to my all reverent whim;Till I got back I was dumb.
