Rise up, rise up,And, as the trumpet blowingChases the dreams of men,As the dawn glowingThe stars that left unlitThe land and water,Rise up and scatterThe dew that coversThe print of last night’s lovers—Scatter it, scatter it!While you are listeningTo the clear horn,Forget, men, everythingOn this earth newborn,Except that it is lovelierThan any mysteries.Open your eyes to the airThat has washed the eyes of the starsThrough all the dewy night:Up with the light,To the old wars;Arise, arise!
