God! How I hate you, you young cheerful men,Whose pious poetry blossoms on your graves As soon as you are in them, nurtured upBy the salt of your corruption, and the tearsOf mothers, local vicars, college deans,And flanked by prefaces and photographsFrom all you minor poet friends—the fools—Who paint their sentimental elegiesWhere sure, no angel treads; and, living, shareThe dead’s brief immortality                                                    Oh Christ!To think that one could spread the ductile waxOf his fluid youth to Oxford’s glowing firesAnd take her seal so ill! Hark how one chants—“Oh happy to have lived these epic days”—“These epic days”! And he’d been to France,And seen the trenches, glimpsed the huddled deadIn the periscope, hung in the rusting wire:Chobed by their sickley fœtor, day and nightBlown down his throat: stumbled through ruined hearths,Proved all that muddy brown monotony,Where blood’s the only coloured thing. PerhapsHad seen a man killed, a sentry shot at night,Hunched as he fell, his feet on the firing-step,His neck against the back slope of the trench,And the rest doubled up between, his headSmashed like and egg-shell, and the warm grey brainSpattered all bloody on the parados:Had flashed a torch on his face, and known his friend,Shot, breathing hardly, in ten minutes—gone!Yet still God’s in His heaven, all is rightIn the best possible of worlds. The woe,Even His scaled eyes must see, is partial, onlyA seeming woe, we cannot understand.God loves us, God looks down on this our strifeAnd smiles in pity, blows a pipe at timesAnd calls some warriors home. We do not die,God would not let us, He is too “intense,”Too “passionate,” a whole day sorrows HeBecause a grass-blade dies. How rare life is!On earth, the love and fellowship of men,Men sternly banded: banded for what end?Banded to maim and kill their fellow men—For even Huns are men. In heaven aboveA genial umpire, a good judge of sport,Won’t let us hurt each other! Let’s rejoiceGod keeps us faithful, pens us still in fold.Ah, what a faith is ours (almost, it seems,Large as a mustard-seed)—we trust and trust,Nothing can shake us! Ah, how good God isTo suffer us to be born just now, when youthThat else would rust, can slake his blade in gore,Where very God Himself does seem to walkThe bloody fields of Flanders He so loves!
