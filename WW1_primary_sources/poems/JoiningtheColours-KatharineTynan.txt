There they go marching all in step so gay!Smooth-cheeked and golden, food for shells and guns.Blithely they go as to a wedding day,The mothers' sons.The drab street stares to see them row on rowOn the high tram-tops, singing like the lark.Too careless-gay for courage, singing they goInto the dark.With tin whistles, mouth-organs, any noise,They pipe the way to glory and the grave;Foolish and young, the gay and golden boysLove cannot save.High heart! High courage! The poor girls they kissedRun with them : they shall kiss no more, alas!Out of the mist they stepped-into the mistSinging they pass.
