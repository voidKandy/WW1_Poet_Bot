Snow is a strange white word;No ice or frostHave asked of bud or birdFor Winter's cost. Yet ice and frost and snowFrom earth to skyThis Summer land doth know,No man knows why. In all men's hearts it is.Some spirit oldHath turned with malign kissOur lives to mould. Red fangs have torn His face.God's blood is shed.He mourns from His lone placeHis children dead. O! ancient crimson curse!Corrode, consume.Give back this universeIts pristine bloom.                            (Cape Town, 1914)
