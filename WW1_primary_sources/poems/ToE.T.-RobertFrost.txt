I slumbered with your poems on my breastSpread open as I dropped them half-read throughLike dove wings on a figure on a tombTo see, if in a dream they brought of you, I might not have the chance I missed in lifeThrough some delay, and call you to your faceFirst soldier, and then poet, and then both,Who died a soldier-poet of your race. I meant, you meant, that nothing should remainUnsaid between us, brother, and this remained—And one thing more that was not then to say:The Victory for what it lost and gained. You went to meet the shell's embrace of fireOn Vimy Ridge; and when you fell that dayThe war seemed over more for you than me,But now for me than you—the other way. How over, though, for even me who knewThe foe thrust back unsafe beyond the Rhine,If I was not to speak of it to youAnd see you pleased once more with words of mine?
