(SUGGESTED INSCRIPTION PROBABLY NOT SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE)The hucksters haggle in the martThe cars and carts go by;Senates and schools go droning on;For dead things cannot die. A storm stooped on the place of tombsWith bolts to blast and rive;But these be names of many menThe lightning found alive. If usurers rule and rights decayAnd visions view once moreGreat Carthage like a golden shellGape hollow on the shore, Still to the last of crumbling timeUpon this stone be readHow many men of England diedTo prove they were not dead.
