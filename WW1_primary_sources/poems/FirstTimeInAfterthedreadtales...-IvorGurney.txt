After the dread tales and red yarns of the LineAnything might have come to us; but the divineAfterglow brought us up to a Welsh colonyHiding in sandbag ditches, whispering consolatorySoft foreign things. Then we were taken inTo low huts candle-lit, shaded close by slitten Oilsheets, and there but boys gave us kind welcome,So that we looked out as from the edge of home,Sang us Welsh things, and changed all former notionsTo human hopeful things. And the next day's gunsNor any Line-pangs ever quite could blot outThat strangely beautiful entry to war's rout;Candles they gave us, precious and shared over-rations—Ulysses found little more in his wanderings without doubt.'David of the White Rock', the 'Slumber Song' so soft, and thatBeautiful tune to which roguish words by Welsh pit boysAre sung—but never more beautiful than here under the guns' noise.
