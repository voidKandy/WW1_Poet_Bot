If it were not for England, who would bearThis heavy servitude one moment more?To keep a brothel, sweep and wash the floorOf filthiest hovels were noble to compareWith this brass-cleaning life. Now here, now thereHarried in foolishness, scanned curiously o'erBy fools made brazen by conceit, and storeOf antique witticisms thin and bare.Only the love of comrades sweetens all,Whose laughing spirit will not be outdone.As night-watching men wait for the sunTo hearten them, so wait I on such boysAs neither brass nor Hell-fire may appal,Nor guns, nor sergeant-major's bluster and noise.
