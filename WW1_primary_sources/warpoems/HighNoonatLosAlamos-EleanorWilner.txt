To turn a stonewith its white squirmingunderneath, to pry the discfrom the sun’s eclipse—white heatcoiling in the blinded eye: to these malign   necessities we comefrom the dim time of dinosaurswho crawled like breathing lavafrom the earth’s cracked crust, and swung   their tiny heads above the lumbering tons   of flesh, brains no bigger than a fistclenched to resist the white flashin the sky the day the sun-flarespared them down to relics for museums,   turned glaciers back, seared Sinai’smeadows black—the ferns withered, the swamps   were melted down to molten mud, the cells   uncoupled, recombined, and madlymultiplied, huge trees toppled to the ground,   the slow life there abandoned hope,a caterpillar stiffened in the grass.Two apes, caught in the act of coupling,   made a mutant childwho woke to sunlight wondering, his mother   torn by the huge new headthat forced the narrow birth canal. As if compelled to repetition   and to unearth againwhite fire at the heart of matter—firewe sought and fire we spoke,our thoughts, however elegant, were firefrom first to last—like sentries set to watch   at Argos for the signal firepassed peak to peak from Troyto Nagasaki, triumphant echo of the burning   city walls and prologue to the murders   yet to come—we scan the skyfor that bright flash,our eyes stared white from watching   for the signal fire that endsthe epic—a cursed linewith its caesura, a pauseto signal peace, or a rehearsalfor the silence.
