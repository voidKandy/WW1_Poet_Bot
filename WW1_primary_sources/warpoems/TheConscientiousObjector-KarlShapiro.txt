The gates clanged and they walked you into jailMore tense than felons but relieved to findThe hostile world shut out, the flags that drippedFrom every mother’s windowpane, obsceneThe bloodlust sweating from the public heart,The dog authority slavering at your throat.A sense of quiet, of pulling down the blindPossessed you. Punishment you felt was clean. The decks, the catwalks, and the narrow lightComposed a ship. This was a mutinous crewTroubling the captains for plain decencies,A Mayflower brim with pilgrims headed outTo establish new theocracies to west,A Noah’s ark coasting the topmost seasTen miles above the sodomites and fish.These inmates loved the only living doves. Like all men hunted from the world you madeA good community, voyaging the stormTo no safe Plymouth or green Ararat;Trouble or calm, the men with Bibles prayed,The gaunt politicals construed our hate.The opposite of all armies, you were bestOpposing uniformity and yourselves;Prison and personality were your fate. You suffered not so physically but knewMaltreatment, hunger, ennui of the mind.Well might the soldier kissing the hot beachErupting in his face damn all your kind.Yet you who saved neither yourselves nor usAre equally with those who shed the bloodThe heroes of our cause. Your conscience isWhat we come back to in the armistice.
