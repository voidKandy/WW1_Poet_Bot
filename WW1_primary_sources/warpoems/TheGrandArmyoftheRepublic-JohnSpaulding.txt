When the soldiers came in their dirty blue shirtsI was kneeling in the garden in the rain.That year only a few ramblers were leftand the trellis had collapsed from the wind.Still I was glad for the water and darkness that clotted the air;the days had seemed sour to me in spite ofthe glory of the vegetables wandering into fall,the fat swollen apples and the wild rosescreeping under the lilac. And there, as the men approached,I stood up near the two willow saplingssprouted from posts but driven in,the larger one, by the neighbor boywhen he entered service, the smaller onewhen he returned home. I could seethe street from where I stood, as though wrappedin gauze, heavy with the nests of caterpillars.(Next week a man with rags tied to stickswould dip them in kerosene andburn the worms that would then dropsquirming onto his arms, his hair, the street.)And then I thought I was lying at the bottom of a pondedged with grayish leaves and looking up to the surface.I saw leaves, raindrops shattering the skylike splinters of glass drifting toward my body;noises seemed echoes as I continued to distance myselffrom what had happened. After thata disbelief, perhaps I had had a stroke, hit my head,or fallen asleep and woke to flies banging against my face.I saw edges of myself being flattened by rain,could smell the earth too and thought of the yearsof rot that made the smell, the rot of my father and his fatherand all those who had gone before and how we eat the rootof the earth and then turn into rot ourselves just aspieces of dirt were grinding away between my teeth and tongue,my bit of gristle being stirred into earthâ€™s stew.I began to raise my head and noticedfor the first time the bunting,red, white, and blue, hung out for the parade.
