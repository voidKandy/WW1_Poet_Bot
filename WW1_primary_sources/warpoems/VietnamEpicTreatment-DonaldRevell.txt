It doesn’t matterA damn what’s playing—In the dead of winterYou go, days of 1978—79, and we wentBecause the soldiers were beautifulAnd doomed as Asian junglesKept afire Christ-likeIn the hopeless warI did not go to in the endBecause it ended. The 20th century?It was a warBetween peasants on the one side,Hallucinations on the other.A peasant is a fire that burnsBut is not consumed.His movie never ends.It will be beautifulEvery winter of our lives, my love,As Christ crushes fire into his woundsAnd the wounds are a jungle.Equally, no matter when their movies end,Hallucinations destroy the destroyers.That’s all.There has never been a President of the United States. And the 21st century?Hallucination vs. hallucinationIn cold battle, in dubious battle,No battle at all because the peasantsHave gone away farInto the lost traveler’s dream,Into a passage from Homer,A woodcutter’s hillsidePeacetime superstition movie. On a cold night, Hector.On a cold night, Achilles.Around the savage and the maniacThe woodcutter draws a ring of fire.It burns all winter long.He never tires of itAnd for good reason:Every face of the flames is doomed and beautiful;Every spark that shoots out into the freezing airIs God’s truthGiven us all over againIn the bitter weather of men’sHallucinations. There has never beenA President of the United States.There has never been a just war.There has never been any lifeBeyond this circle of firelightUntil now if now is no dream but an Asia.
