The young man, hardly morethan a boy, who fired the shothad looked at him with an airnot of anger but of concentration,as if he were surveying a road,or feeding a length of wood into a saw:It had to be done just so. The bullet passed throughhis upper chest, below the collar bone.The pain was not what he mighthave feared. Strangely exhilaratedhe staggered out of the pastureand into a grove of trees. He pressed and pressedthe wound, trying to stanchthe blood, but he could only presswhat he could reach, and he couldnot reach his back, where the bullethad exited.                     He lay on the earthsmelling the leaves and mosses,musty and damp and coolafter the blaze of open afternoon. How good the earth smelled,as it had when he was a boyhiding from his father,who was intent of strapping himfor doing his choreslate one time too many. A cowbird razzed from a rail fence.It isn't mockery, he thought,no malice in it. . . just a noise.Stray bullets nicked the oaksoverhead. Leaves and splinters fell. Someone near him groaned.But it was his own voice he heard.His fingers and feet tingled,the roof of his mouth,and the bridge of his nose. . . . He became dry, dry, and thoughtof Christ, who said, I thirst.His man-smell, the smell of his hairand skin, his sweat, the salt smellof his cock and the little ferny hairsthat two women had known left him, and a sharp, almost sweetsmell began to rise from his open mouthin the warm shade of the oaks.A streak of sun climbed the roughtrunk of a tree, but he did notsee it with his open eye.
