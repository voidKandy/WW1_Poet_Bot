To our land,and it is the one near the word of god,a ceiling of cloudsTo our land,and it is the one far from the adjectives of nouns,the map of absenceTo our land,and it is the one tiny as a sesame seed,a heavenly horizon ... and a hidden chasmTo our land,and it is the one poor as a grouse’s wings,holy books ... and an identity woundTo our land,and it is the one surrounded with torn hills,the ambush of a new pastTo our land, and it is a prize of war,the freedom to die from longing and burningand our land, in its bloodied night,is a jewel that glimmers for the far upon the farand illuminates what’s outside it ...As for us, inside,we suffocate more!
