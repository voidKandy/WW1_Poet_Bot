This afternoon was the colour of water falling through sunlight;The trees glittered with the tumbling of leaves;The sidewalks shone like alleys of dropped maple leaves,And the houses ran along them laughing out of square, open windows.Under a tree in the park,Two little boys, lying flat on their faces,Were carefully gathering red berriesTo put in a pasteboard box.Some day there will be no war,Then I shall take out this afternoonAnd turn it in my fingers,And remark the sweet taste of it upon my palate,And note the crisp variety of its flights of leaves.To-day I can only gather itAnd put it into my lunch-box,For I have time for nothingBut the endeavour to balance myselfUpon a broken world.
