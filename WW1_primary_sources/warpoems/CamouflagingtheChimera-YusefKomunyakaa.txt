We tied branches to our helmets.We painted our faces & rifleswith mud from a riverbank, blades of grass hung from the pocketsof our tiger suits. We woveourselves into the terrain,content to be a hummingbird’s target. We hugged bamboo & leanedagainst a breeze off the river,slow-dragging with ghosts from Saigon to Bangkok,with women left in doorwaysreaching in from America.We aimed at dark-hearted songbirds. In our way station of shadowsrock apes tried to blow our cover,throwing stones at the sunset. Chameleons crawled our spines, changing from dayto night: green to gold,gold to black. But we waitedtill the moon touched metal, till something almost brokeinside us. VC struggledwith the hillside, like black silk wrestling iron through grass.We weren’t there. The river ranthrough our bones. Small animals took refugeagainst our bodies; we held our breath, ready to spring the L-shapedambush, as a world revolvedunder each man’s eyelid.
