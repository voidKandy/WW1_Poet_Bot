for The PeopleThe people don't mention it much.It goes without saying,it stays without saying— that concentration campon their reservation. And they avoid that massive siteas they avoid contamination— that massive voidpunctuated by crusted nails,punctured pipes, crumbledfailings of foundations . . . What else is there to say? This was a lush land once,graced by a gifted peoplegifted with the wisdomof rivers, seasons, irrigation. The waters went flowingthrough a network of canalsin the delicate workingsof balances and health . . . What else is there to say? Then came the nation.Then came the death. Then came the desert.Then came the camp. But the desert is not deserted.It goes without saying,it stays without saying— wind, spirits, tumbleweeds, pain.
