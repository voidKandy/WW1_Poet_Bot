Not the peace of a cease-fire,not even the vision of the wolf and the lamb,but ratheras in the heart when the excitement is overand you can talk only about a great weariness.I know that I know how to kill,that makes me an adult.And my son plays with a toy gun that knowshow to open and close its eyes and say Mama.A peacewithout the big noise of beating swords into ploughshares,without words, withoutthe thud of the heavy rubber stamp: let it belight, floating, like lazy white foam.A little rest for the woundsâ€”who speaks of healing?(And the howl of the orphans is passed from one generationto the next, as in a relay race:the baton never falls.) Let it comelike wildflowers,suddenly, because the fieldmust have it: wildpeace.
