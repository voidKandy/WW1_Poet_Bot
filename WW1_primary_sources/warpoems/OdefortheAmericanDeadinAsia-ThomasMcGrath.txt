1. God love you now, if no one else will ever,Corpse in the paddy, or dead on a high hillIn the fine and ruinous summer of a warYou never wanted. All your false flags wereOf bravery and ignorance, like grade school maps:Colors of countries you would never see—Until that weekend in eternityWhen, laughing, well armed, perfectly ready to killThe world and your brother, the safe commanders sentYou into your future. Oh, dead on a hill,Dead in a paddy, leeched and tumbled toA tomb of footnotes. We mourn a changeling: you:Handselled to poverty and drummed to warBy distinguished masters whom you never knew. 2. The bee that spins his metal from the sun,The shy mole drifting like a miner ghostThrough midnight earth—all happy creatures runAs strict as trains on rails the circuits ofBlind instinct. Happy in your summer follies,You mined a culture that was mined for war:The state to mold you, church to bless, and alwaysThe elders to confirm you in your ignorance.No scholar put your thinking cap on norWarned that in dead seas fishes died in schoolsBefore inventing legs to walk the land.The rulers stuck a tennis racket in your hand,An Ark against the flood. In time of changeCourage is not enough: the blind mole dies,And you on your hill, who did not know the rules. 3. Wet in the windy counties of the dawnThe lone crow skirls his draggled passage home:And God (whose sparrows fall aslant his gaze,Like grace or confetti) blinks and he is gone,And you are gone. Your scarecrow valor growsAnd rusts like early lilac while the roseBlooms in Dakota and the stock exchangeFlowers. Roses, rents, all things conspireTo crown your death with wreaths of living fire.And the public mourners come: the politic tearIs cast in the Forum. But, in another year,We will mourn you, whose fossil courage fillsThe limestone histories: brave: ignorant: amazed:Dead in the rice paddies, dead on the nameless hills.
