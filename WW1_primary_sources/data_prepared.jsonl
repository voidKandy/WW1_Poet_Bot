Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumblingFitting the clumsy helmets just in time,But someone still was yelling out and stumblingAnd flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. In all my dreams before my helpless sight,He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. If in some smothering dreams, you too could paceBehind the wagon that we flung him in,And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,His hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;If you could hear, at every jolt, the bloodCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cudOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—My friend, you would not tell with such high zestTo children ardent for some desperate glory,The old Lie: Dulce et decorum estPro patria mori.\n"}

Foes distraught Pierced the thinned peoples in a brute-like blindness, Philosophies that sages long had taught, And Selflessness, were as an unknown thought, And “Hell!” and “Shell!” were yapped at Lovingkindness.                                            III The feeble folk at home had grown full-used To 'dug-outs', 'snipers', 'Huns', from the war-adept In the mornings heard, and at evetides perused; To day-dreamt men in millions, when they mused— To nightmare-men in millions when they slept.                                            IV Wfaking to wish existence timeless, null, Sirius they watched above where armies fell; He seemed to check his flapping when, in the lull Of night a boom came thencewise, like the dull Plunge of a stone dropped into some deep well.                                            V So, when old hopes that earth was bettering slowly Were dead and damned, there sounded 'War is done!' One morrow. Said the bereft, and meek, and lowly,'Will men some day be given to grace? yea, wholly, And in good sooth, as our dreams used to run?'                                            VI Breathless they paused. Out there men raised their glance To where had stood those poplars lank and lopped, As they had raised it through the four years’ dance Of Death in the now familiar flats of France; And murmured, 'Strange, this! How? All firing stopped?'                                            VII Aye; all was hushed. The about-to-fire fired not, The aimed-at moved away in trance-lipped song. One checkless regiment slung a clinching shot And turned. The Spirit of Irony smirked out, 'What? Spoil peradventures woven of Rage and Wrong?'                                            VIII Thenceforth no flying fires inflamed the gray, No hurtlings shook the dewdrop from the thorn, No moan perplexed the mute bird on the spray; Worn horses mused: 'We are not whipped to-day;' No weft-winged engines blurred the moon’s thin horn.                                            IX Calm fell. From Heaven distilled a clemency; There was peace on earth, and silence in the sky; Some could, some could not, shake off misery: The Sinister Spirit sneered: 'It had to be!'

Each week, month after month, they wrote the same, Thinking him sheltered in some Y.M. Hut, Because he said so, writing on his butt Where once an hour a bullet missed its aim And misses teased the hunger of his brain. His eyes grew old with wincing, and his hand Reckless with ague. Courage leaked, as sand From the best sand-bags after years of rain. But never leave, wound, fever, trench-foot, shock, Untrapped the wretch. And death seemed still withheld For torture of lying machinally shelled, At the pleasure of this world’s Powers who’d run amok.   He’d seen men shoot their hands, on night patrol.

{"prompt":"Write a poem about the consequences of war on women who are not wives ->","completion":" There is something in the sound of drum and fife That stirs all the savage instincts into life.   In the old times of peace we went our ways, Through proper days Of little joys and tasks. Lonely at times, When from the steeple sounded wedding chimes, Telling to all the world some maid was wife— But taking patiently our part in life As it was portioned us by Church and State, Believing it our fate.     Our thoughts all chaste Held yet a secret wish to love and mate     Ere youth and virtue should go quite to waste. But men we criticised for lack of strength, And kept them at arm's length. Then the war came— The world was all aflame! The men we had thought dull and void of power Were heroes in an hour. He who had seemed a slave to petty greed Showed masterful in that great time of need. He who had plotted for his neighbour's pelf, Now for his fellows offers up himself. And we were only women, forced by war To sacrifice the things worth living for.   Something within us broke,    Something within us woke,        The wild cave-woman spoke.   When we heard the sound of drumming,    As our soldiers went to camp,    Heard them tramp, tramp, tramp; As we watched to see them coming,    And they looked at us and smiled    (Yes, looked back at us and smiled), As they filed along by hillock and by hollow,    Then our hearts were so beguiled    That, for many and many a day,    We dreamed we heard them say, 'Oh, follow, follow, follow!'    And the distant, rolling drum    Called us 'Come, come, come!'    Till our virtue seemed a thing to give away.   War had swept ten thousand years away from earth.    We were primal once again.    There were males, not modern men; We were females meant to bring their sons to birth.    And we could not wait for any formal rite,    We could hear them calling to us, 'Come to-night; For to-morrow, at the dawn, We move on!'    And the drum    Bellowed, 'Come, come, come!' And the fife Whistled, 'Life, life, life!'   So they moved on and fought and bled and died; Honoured and mourned, they are the nation's pride. We fought our battles, too, but with the tide Of our red blood, we gave the world new lives. Because we were not wives We are dishonoured. Is it noble, then, To break God's laws only by killing men To save one's country from destruction? We took no man's life but gave our chastity, And sinned the ancient sin To plant young trees and fill felled forests in.   Oh, clergy of the land, Bible in hand, All reverently you stand,    On holy thoughts intent    While barren wives receive the sacrament! Had you the open visions you could see    Phantoms of infants murdered in the womb,    Who never knew a cradle or a tomb, Hovering about these wives accusingly.   Bestow the sacrament! Their sins are not well known— Ours to the four winds of the earth are blown.\n"}

In heaven aboveA genial umpire, a good judge of sport,Won’t let us hurt each other! Let’s rejoiceGod keeps us faithful, pens us still in fold.Ah, what a faith is ours (almost, it seems,Large as a mustard-seed)—we trust and trust,Nothing can shake us! Ah, how good God isTo suffer us to be born just now, when youthThat else would rust, can slake his blade in gore,Where very God Himself does seem to walkThe bloody fields of Flanders He so loves!\n"}

Fair, too, was afternoon, and first to pass Were we that league of snow, next the north wind.   There was nothing to return for, except need, And yet we sang nor ever stopped for speed, As we did often with the start behind. Faster still strode we when we came in sight Of the cold roofs where we must spend the night. Happy we had not been there, nor could be. Though we had tasted sleep and food and fellowship Together long.                             “How quick” to someone's lip The words came, “will the beaten horse run home.”   The word “home” raised a smile in us all three, And one repeated it, smiling just so That all knew what he meant and none would say. Between three counties far apart that lay We were divided and looked strangely each At the other, and we knew we were not friends But fellows in a union that ends With the necessity for it, as it ought.  Never a word was spoken, not a thought Was thought, of what the look meant with the word “Home” as we walked and watched the sunset blurred. And then to me the word, only the word, “Homesick,” as it were playfully occurred: No more. If I should ever more admit Than the mere word I could not endure it For a day longer: this captivity Must somehow come to an end, else I should be Another man, as often now I seem, Or this life be only an evil dream.\n"}

Here, by devoted comrades laid away,    Along our lines they slumber where they fell, Beside the crater at the Ferme d’Alger    And up the bloody slopes of La Pompelle,   And round the city whose cathedral towers    The enemies of Beauty dared profane, And in the mat of multicolored flowers    That clothe the sunny chalk-fields of Champagne.   Under the little crosses where they rise    The soldier rests. Now round him undismayed The cannon thunders, and at night he lies    At peace beneath the eternal fusillade ...   That other generations might possess—    From shame and menace free in years to come— A richer heritage of happiness,    He marched to that heroic martyrdom.   Esteeming less the forfeit that he paid    Than undishonored that his flag might float Over the towers of liberty, he made    His breast the bulwark and his blood the moat.   Obscurely sacrificed, his nameless tomb,    Bare of the sculptor’s art, the poet’s lines, Summer shall flush with poppy-fields in bloom,    And Autumn yellow with maturing vines.   There the grape-pickers at their harvesting    Shall lightly tread and load their wicker trays, Blessing his memory as they toil and sing    In the slant sunshine of October days ...   I love to think that if my blood should be    So privileged to sink where his has sunk, I shall not pass from Earth entirely,    But when the banquet rings, when healths are drunk,   And faces that the joys of living fill    Glow radiant with laughter and good cheer, In beaming cups some spark of me shall still    Brim toward the lips that once I held so dear.   So shall one coveting no higher plane    Than nature clothes in color and flesh and tone, Even from the grave put upward to attain    The dreams youth cherished and missed and might have known;   And that strong need that strove unsatisfied    Toward earthly beauty in all forms it wore, Not death itself shall utterly divide    From the belovèd shapes it thirsted for.   Alas, how many an adept for whose arms    Life held delicious offerings perished here, How many in the prime of all that charms,    Crowned with all gifts that conquer and endear!   Honor them not so much with tears and flowers,    But you with whom the sweet fulfilment lies, Where in the anguish of atrocious hours    Turned their last thoughts and closed their dying eyes,   Rather when music on bright gatherings lays    Its tender spell, and joy is uppermost, Be mindful of the men they were, and raise    Your glasses to them in one silent toast.   Drink to them—amorous of dear Earth as well,    They asked no tribute lovelier than this— And in the wine that ripened where they fell,    Oh, frame your lips as though it were a kiss.\n"}

Silence and safety; and his mortal shore  Lipped by the inward, moonless waves of death.    Someone was holding water to his mouth.  He swallowed, unresisting; moaned and dropped  Through crimson gloom to darkness; and forgot  The opiate throb and ache that was his wound.  Water—calm, sliding green above the weir;  Water—a sky-lit alley for his boat,  Bird-voiced, and bordered with reflected flowers  And shaken hues of summer: drifting down,  He dipped contented oars, and sighed, and slept.    Night, with a gust of wind, was in the ward,  Blowing the curtain to a gummering curve.  Night. He was blind; he could not see the stars  Glinting among the wraiths of wandering cloud;  Queer blots of colour, purple, scarlet, green,  Flickered and faded in his drowning eyes.    Rain—he could hear it rustling through the dark;  Fragrance and passionless music woven as one;  Warm rain on drooping roses; pattering showers  That soak the woods; not the harsh rain that sweeps  Behind the thunder, but a trickling peace,  Gently and slowly washing life away.  He stirred, shifting his body; then the pain  Leaped like a prowling beast, and gripped and tore  His groping dreams with grinding claws and fangs.  But someone was beside him; soon he lay  Shuddering because that evil thing had passed.  And death, who'd stepped toward him, paused and stared.    Light many lamps and gather round his bed.  Lend him your eyes, warm blood, and will to live.  Speak to him; rouse him; you may save him yet.  He's young; he hated war; how should he die  When cruel old campaigners win safe through?    But death replied: “I choose him.” So he went,  And there was silence in the summer night;  Silence and safety; and the veils of sleep.  Then, far away, the thudding of the guns.\n"}

They lay, all clothed,Each in some new and piteous attitudeThat we well marked to guide us back: as he,Outside our wire, that lay on his back and crossedHis legs Crusader-wise: I smiled at that,And thought on Elia and his Temple Church.From him, at quarter left, lay a small corpse,Down in a hollow, huddled as in a bed,That one of us put his hand on unawares.Next was a bunch of half a dozen menAll blown to bits, an archipelagoOf corrupt fragments, vexing to us three,Who had no light to see by, save the flares.On such a trail, so light, for ninety yardsWe crawled on belly and elbows, till we saw,Instead of lumpish dead before our eyes,The stakes and crosslines of the German wire.We lay in shelter of the last dead man,Ourselves as dead, and heard their shovels ringTurning the earth, then talk and cough at times.A sentry fired and a machine-gun spat;They shot a glare above us, when it fellAnd spluttered out in the pools of No Man’s Land,We turned and crawled past the remembered dead:Past him and him, and them and him, until,For he lay some way apart, we caught the scentOf the Crusader and slide past his legs,And through the wire and home, and got our rum.\n"}

This is the song of the mud, the uniform of the poilu. His coat is of mud, his great dragging flapping coat, that is too big for him and too heavy; His coat that once was blue and now is grey and stiff with the mud that cakes to it. This is the mud that clothes him. His trousers and boots are of mud, And his skin is of mud; And there is mud in his beard. His head is crowned with a helmet of mud. He wears it well. He wears it as a king wears the ermine that bores him. He has set a new style in clothing; He has introduced the chic of mud. This is the song of the mud that wriggles its way into battle. The impertinent, the intrusive, the ubiquitous, the unwelcome, The slimy inveterate nuisance, That fills the trenches, That mixes in with the food of the soldiers, That spoils the working of motors and crawls into their secret parts, That spreads itself over the guns, That sucks the guns down and holds them fast in its slimy voluminous lips, That has no respect for destruction and muzzles the bursting shells; And slowly, softly, easily, Soaks up the fire, the noise; soaks up the energy and the courage; Soaks up the power of armies; Soaks up the battle. Just soaks it up and thus stops it. This is the hymn of mud-the obscene, the filthy, the putrid, The vast liquid grave of our armies. It has drowned our men. Its monstrous distended belly reeks with the undigested dead. Our men have gone into it, sinking slowly, and struggling and slowly disappearing. Our fine men, our brave, strong, young men; Our glowing red, shouting, brawny men. Slowly, inch by inch, they have gone down into it, Into its darkness, its thickness, its silence. Slowly, irresistibly, it drew them down, sucked them down, And they were drowned in thick, bitter, heaving mud. Now it hides them, Oh, so many of them! Under its smooth glistening surface it is hiding them blandly. There is not a trace of them. There is no mark where they went down. The mute enormous mouth of the mud has closed over them. This is the song of the mud, The beautiful glistening golden mud that covers the hills like satin; The mysterious gleaming silvery mud that is spread like enamel over the valleys. Mud, the disguise of the war zone; Mud, the mantle of battles; Mud, the smooth fluid grave of our soldiers: This is the song of the mud.\n"}

We held their line, With bombers posted, Lewis guns well placed, And clink of shovels deepening the shallow trench.The place was rotten with dead; green clumsy legsHigh-booted, sprawled and grovelled along the sapsAnd trunks, face downward, in the sucking mud,Wallowed like trodden sand-bags loosely filled;And naked sodden buttocks, mats of hair,Bulged, clotted heads slept in the plastering slime.And then the rain began,—the jolly old rain!   A yawning soldier knelt against the bank, Staring across the morning blear with fog; He wondered when the Allemands would get busy; And then, of course, they started with five-nines Traversing, sure as fate, and never a dud. Mute in the clamour of shells he watched them burst Spouting dark earth and wire with gusts from hell, While posturing giants dissolved in drifts of smoke. He crouched and flinched, dizzy with galloping fear, Sick for escape,—loathing the strangled horror And butchered, frantic gestures of the dead.   An officer came blundering down the trench: “Stand-to and man the fire step!” On he went ... Gasping and bawling, “Fire-step ... counter-attack!”Then the haze lifted. Bombing on the rightDown the old sap: machine-guns on the left;And stumbling figures looming out in front.“O Christ, they’re coming at us!” Bullets spat, And he remembered his rifle ... rapid fire ... And started blazing wildly ... then a bang Crumpled and spun him sideways, knocked him out To grunt and wriggle: none heeded him; he choked And fought the flapping veils of smothering gloom, Lost in a blurred confusion of yells and groans ... Down, and down, and down, he sank and drowned, Bleeding to death. The counter-attack had failed.\n"}

His spirit halted not; In that long battle afar, Fruitless in all but fame, Athos and Ida saw Where sank his gallant star.   O well could I set my mood To a mournful falling measure For a friend dear and dead! And well could memory brood Singing of youth’s delight And lost adventure fled.

Earth has waited for them, All the time of their growth Fretting for their decay: Now she has them at last! In the strength of their strength Suspended—stopped and held.  What fierce imaginings their dark souls lit? Earth! have they gone into you! Somewhere they must have gone, And flung on your hard back Is their soul’s sack Emptied of God-ancestralled essences. Who hurled them out? Who hurled?  None saw their spirits’ shadow shake the grass, Or stood aside for the half used life to pass Out of those doomed nostrils and the doomed mouth, When the swift iron burning bee Drained the wild honey of their youth.  What of us who, flung on the shrieking pyre, Walk, our usual thoughts untouched, Our lucky limbs as on ichor fed, Immortal seeming ever? Perhaps when the flames beat loud on us, A fear may choke in our veins And the startled blood may stop.  The air is loud with death, The dark air spurts with fire, The explosions ceaseless are. Timelessly now, some minutes past, Those dead strode time with vigorous life, Till the shrapnel called ‘An end!’ But not to all. In bleeding pangs Some borne on stretchers dreamed of home, Dear things, war-blotted from their hearts.  Maniac Earth! howling and flying, your bowel Seared by the jagged fire, the iron love, The impetuous storm of savage love. Dark Earth! dark Heavens! swinging in chemic smoke, What dead are born when you kiss each soundless soul With lightning and thunder from your mined heart, Which man’s self dug, and his blind fingers loosed?  A man’s brains splattered on A stretcher-bearer’s face; His shook shoulders slipped their load, But when they bent to look again The drowning soul was sunk too deep For human tenderness.  They left this dead with the older dead, Stretched at the cross roads.  Burnt black by strange decay Their sinister faces lie, The lid over each eye, The grass and coloured clay More motion have than they, Joined to the great sunk silences.  Here is one not long dead; His dark hearing caught our far wheels, And the choked soul stretched weak hands To reach the living word the far wheels said, The blood-dazed intelligence beating for light, Crying through the suspense of the far torturing wheels Swift for the end to break Or the wheels to break, Cried as the tide of the world broke over his sight.  Will they come? Will they ever come? Even as the mixed hoofs of the mules, The quivering-bellied mules, And the rushing wheels all mixed With his tortured upturned sight. So we crashed round the bend, We heard his weak scream, We heard his very last sound, And our wheels grazed his dead face.\n"}

Of Maconachie, Paxton, Tickler, and Gloucester's Stephens; Fray Bentos, Spiller and Baker, odds and evens Of trench food, but the everlasting clean craving For bread, the pure thing, blessed beyond saving.

But Laventie, most of all, I think is to soldiers The Town itself with plane trees, and small-spa air; And vin, rouge-blanc, chocolat, citron, grenadine: One might buy in small delectable cafés there. The broken church, and vegetable fields bare; Neat French market town look so clean, And the clarity, amiability of North French air.

Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned, Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred. Then, as I probed them, one sprang up, and stared With piteous recognition in fixed eyes, Lifting distressful hands, as if to bless. And by his smile, I knew that sullen hall,— By his dead smile I knew we stood in Hell. With a thousand fears that vision's face was grained; Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground, And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan. “Strange friend,” I said, “here is no cause to mourn.” “None,” said that other, “save the undone years, The hopelessness. Whatever hope is yours, Was my life also; I went hunting wild After the wildest beauty in the world, Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair, But mocks the steady running of the hour, And if it grieves, grieves richlier than here. For by my glee might many men have laughed, And of my weeping something had been left, Which must die now. I mean the truth untold, The pity of war, the pity war distilled. Now men will go content with what we spoiled. Or, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled. They will be swift with swiftness of the tigress. None will break ranks, though nations trek from progress. Courage was mine, and I had mystery; Wisdom was mine, and I had mastery: To miss the march of this retreating world Into vain citadels that are not walled. Then, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels, I would go up and wash them from sweet wells, Even with truths that lie too deep for taint. I would have poured my spirit without stint But not through wounds; not on the cess of war. Foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were. “I am the enemy you killed, my friend.

Your scarecrow valor growsAnd rusts like early lilac while the roseBlooms in Dakota and the stock exchangeFlowers. Roses, rents, all things conspireTo crown your death with wreaths of living fire.And the public mourners come: the politic tearIs cast in the Forum.

Then, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels, I would go up and wash them from sweet wells, Even with truths that lie too deep for taint.
